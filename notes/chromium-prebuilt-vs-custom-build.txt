The Chromium used for tracing is a custom build through the FreeBSD ports tree.
These notes discuss the difference to the pre-built Chromium, mainly to assess
the worthiness of the custom Chromium build. 

The custom build uses the MEMORY_TOOL_REPLACES_ALLOCATOR option, which causes
some of Chromium's allocators to bypass to the system allocator.  This should
increase the number of allocations seen by the tracing, since the tracing is
concerned with the system allocator.

Pre-built Chromium          82709037  (+ 0%)            41942801 (+ 0%)
Own Chromium build          285907428 (+ 345%)          63671038 (+ 51%)
